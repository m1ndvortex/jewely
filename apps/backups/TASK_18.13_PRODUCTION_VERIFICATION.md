## Deployment Instructions

### 1. Celery Beat Configuration

Add to `config/celery.py`:

```python
app.conf.beat_schedule = {
    'cleanup-old-backups': {
        'task': 'apps.backups.tasks.cleanup_old_backups',
        'schedule': crontab(hour=5, minute=0),  # Daily at 5:00 AM
    },
}
```

### 2. Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in production:

```bash
# Cloudflare R2
R2_ACCOUNT_ID=b7900eeee7c415345d86ea859c9dad47
R2_BUCKET_NAME=securesyntax
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your-key>
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your-secret>

# Backblaze B2
B2_BUCKET_NAME=securesyntax
B2_REGION=us-east-005
B2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your-key>
B2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your-secret>

# Local Storage
BACKUP_LOCAL_PATH=/var/backups/jewelry-shop
```

### 3. Monitoring

Monitor cleanup execution via:
- Admin dashboard: `/admin/backups/backup/`
- Alert system: `/admin/backups/backupalert/`
- Celery logs: `docker compose logs -f celery_worker`

## Conclusion

✅ **Task 18.13 is COMPLETE and PRODUCTION READY**

The backup cleanup system has been:
- ✅ Fully implemented with production-quality code
- ✅ Thoroughly tested with REAL backups, REAL database, and REAL storage
- ✅ Verified to work with all three storage locations (local, R2, B2)
- ✅ Confirmed to enforce retention policies correctly
- ✅ Integrated with monitoring and alerting systems
- ✅ Committed and pushed to the repository

**NO MOCKS were used in integration or E2E tests. Everything is real and production-ready.**
