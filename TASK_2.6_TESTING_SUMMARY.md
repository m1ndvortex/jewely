# Task 2.6 Bill Management Templates - Testing Summary

## Testing Date
November 1, 2025

## Overview
Tested the bill management templates created in task 2.6 using Playwright browser automation to ensure all links are navigatable through the UI and that bills can be created successfully.

## Navigation Path to Bills

To access the Bills management interface through the UI:

1. **Start**: Login to the application at `http://localhost:8000`
2. **Click**: "More" button in the top navigation menu
3. **Click**: "Accounting" link in the dropdown menu
4. **Navigate**: You'll be on the Accounting Dashboard
5. **Click**: "Accounts Payable" card (labeled "PAYABLES")
   - **Note**: This currently shows Purchase Orders, not Bills
   - **Direct URL**: `http://localhost:8000/accounting/bills/` works directly

### Recommended Fix
Add a direct "Bills" link to the Accounting Dashboard or update the Accounts Payable page to include a link to Bills.

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Template Error - `abs` Filter
**Issue**: The `abs` filter is not available by default in Django templates.
**Location**: `templates/accounting/bills/list.html` line 279
**Fix**: Replaced `{{ bill.days_overdue|abs }}` with conditional logic to handle negative values
**Status**: ✅ Fixed

### 2. Formset Initialization Error
**Issue**: `'NoneType' object has no attribute '_prefetch_related_lookups'`
**Root Cause**: The BillLineForm's account field queryset was None when COA was not provided
**Location**: `apps/accounting/forms.py` - BillLineForm `__init__` method
**Fix**: Added fallback to set empty queryset when COA is None:
```python
else:
    # Set empty queryset if no COA provided
    self.fields["account"].queryset = AccountModel.objects.none()
```
**Status**: ✅ Fixed

### 3. View Initialization Error
**Issue**: Formset couldn't be initialized without an instance
**Location**: `apps/accounting/views.py` - `bill_create` function
**Fix**: Created temporary unsaved Bill instance for formset initialization:
```python
from .bill_models import Bill as BillModel
temp_bill = BillModel()
formset = BillLineInlineFormSet(instance=temp_bill, tenant=request.user.tenant, coa=coa)
```
**Status**: ✅ Fixed

## Templates Created

**Location**: `templates/accounting/bills/list.html`
**Features**:

**Features**:
