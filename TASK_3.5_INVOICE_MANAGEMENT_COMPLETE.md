## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Create invoice with multiple line items
- [ ] Verify journal entry created correctly
- [ ] Check credit limit warning appears
- [ ] Record payment and verify journal entry
- [ ] Create credit memo and verify journal entry
- [ ] Apply credit memo to invoice
- [ ] Test all filters on invoice list
- [ ] Verify tenant isolation (cannot see other tenant's invoices)
- [ ] Check audit logs created for all operations

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Test with existing Customer model from CRM

   - invoice form template
   - invoice detail template
   - payment form template
   - credit memo templates

2. **Task 3.7**: Create aged receivables report (backend + frontend)
   - Report view using InvoiceService.get_aged_receivables()
