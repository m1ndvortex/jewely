## URL Routes Added

```python
# Customer Accounting Views (Task 3.3)
path(
    "customers/<uuid:customer_id>/accounting/",
    views.customer_accounting_detail,
    name="customer_accounting_detail",
),
path(
    "customers/<uuid:customer_id>/statement/",
    views.customer_statement,
    name="customer_statement",
),
path(
    "api/customers/<uuid:customer_id>/check-credit-limit/",
    views.check_customer_credit_limit_api,
    name="check_customer_credit_limit_api",
),
```

## Security & Compliance

### Tenant Isolation (Requirement 15.7)
- All views use `@tenant_access_required` decorator
- All database queries filter by `tenant=request.user.tenant`
- Uses `get_object_or_404` to ensure tenant-scoped access
- Prevents cross-tenant data access

### Audit Logging (Requirement 15.8)
- All views create audit log entries using `AuditLog` model
- Logs include:
  - User who performed the action
  - Timestamp
  - IP address
  - User agent
  - Request method and path
  - Description of action
  - Severity level (INFO or WARNING for credit limit issues)

## Data Displayed

### Customer Accounting Detail
- Customer basic information (name, contact, credit limit, payment terms)
- All invoices with status, dates, and amounts
- Outstanding invoices list
- Outstanding balance total
- Recent payments (last 20)
- Total sales amount
- Credit utilization percentage
- Over credit limit warning (if applicable)
- Average days to pay
- Payment reliability score (0-100)

### Customer Statement
- Customer information
- Date range for statement
- All transactions (invoices and payments) in date order
- Running balance after each transaction
- Current outstanding balance
- Transaction details:
  - Date
  - Type (invoice/payment)
  - Reference number
  - Description
  - Debit/Credit amounts
  - Balance

## Payment Statistics Calculation

### Average Days to Pay
- Calculated from paid invoices
- Measures time from invoice date to final payment date
- Helps assess customer payment behavior

### Payment Reliability Score (0-100)
Starts at 100 and deducts points for:
- Late payments: -10 points per overdue invoice (max -40)
- Slow payment: -0.5 points per day over 30 days (max -30)
- High credit utilization: -20 points if >80%, -10 points if >50%
- Minimum score: 0

## Integration with Existing Models

### Customer Model (apps/crm/models.py)
Already includes accounting fields:
- `credit_limit`: Maximum credit allowed
- `payment_terms`: Default payment terms (e.g., NET30)
- `tax_exempt`: Whether customer is tax-exempt
- `exemption_certificate`: Tax exemption certificate file

### Invoice Model (apps/accounting/invoice_models.py)
- Links to Customer via foreign key
- Tracks invoice status, amounts, payments
- Includes journal entry for double-entry bookkeeping

### InvoicePayment Model (apps/accounting/invoice_models.py)
- Links to Invoice
- Tracks payment date, amount, method
- Includes reference number and notes
