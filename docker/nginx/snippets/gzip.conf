# Gzip Compression Configuration
# Compresses text-based files for faster transfer and reduced bandwidth usage
# Requirement 22: Nginx Configuration - Enable gzip compression for text-based files

# Enable gzip compression
gzip on;

# Add Vary: Accept-Encoding header to responses
# This tells caches that the response varies based on the Accept-Encoding header
gzip_vary on;

# Enable compression for all proxied requests
gzip_proxied any;

# Compression level (1-9)
# Level 6 provides good balance between compression ratio and CPU usage
# Higher levels provide diminishing returns

# MIME types to compress
# Covers all common text-based formats
