# Task 20.2: Audit Log Explorer - Implementation Complete

## Summary

Successfully implemented a comprehensive audit log explorer system with advanced search, filtering, CSV export, and retention policy management per Requirement 8.2.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Backend Views (`apps/core/audit_views.py`)

**Main Explorer Views:**
- `AuditLogExplorerView` - Main audit log list with advanced search and filtering
- `AuditLogDetailView` - Detailed view of individual audit log entries
- `AuditLogExportView` - CSV export functionality with filtering support
- `LoginAttemptExplorerView` - Specialized view for login attempt monitoring
- `DataChangeLogExplorerView` - View for tracking data modifications
- `APIRequestLogExplorerView` - API request monitoring and performance tracking

**Retention Policy Management:**
- `AuditLogRetentionView` - Interface for managing retention policies
- `AuditLogRetentionExecuteView` - Execute retention cleanup with safety checks
- `AuditLogStatsAPIView` - Statistics API for dashboard widgets

### 2. Advanced Filtering Capabilities

**Supported Filters:**
- User (by user ID)
- Action type (from predefined action choices)
- Category (ADMIN, USER, DATA, API, SECURITY, SYSTEM)
- Severity (INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
- Tenant (by tenant ID)
- IP address
- Date range (from/to dates)
- Quick filters (today, yesterday, last 7/30/90 days)
- Search query (description, username, email, IP, path)

### 3. CSV Export Functionality

**Features:**
- Exports filtered audit logs to CSV format
- Includes all relevant fields (timestamp, category, action, user, description, IP, etc.)
- Limits export to 10,000 records to prevent memory issues
- Applies same filtering logic as the list view
- Timestamped filenames for easy organization

### 4. Retention Policy Management

**Features:**
- View statistics by log type and age
- Configure retention period (minimum 30 days for compliance)
- Select specific log types or all logs
- Quick presets (90 days, 180 days, 1 year, 2 years)
- Confirmation checkbox for safety
- Real-time execution with progress feedback
- Automatic page reload after cleanup

**Safety Measures:**
- Minimum 30-day retention enforced
- Confirmation required before execution
- Detailed deletion counts returned
- All retention executions logged in audit trail

### 5. URL Routes (`apps/core/urls.py`)

Added 9 new URL patterns:
- `/platform/audit-logs/` - Main explorer
- `/platform/audit-logs/<uuid:pk>/` - Detail view
- `/platform/audit-logs/export/` - CSV export
- `/platform/audit-logs/login-attempts/` - Login attempts
- `/platform/audit-logs/data-changes/` - Data changes
- `/platform/audit-logs/api-requests/` - API requests
- `/platform/audit-logs/retention/` - Retention policy
- `/platform/audit-logs/retention/execute/` - Execute retention
- `/platform/api/audit-logs/stats/` - Statistics API

### 6. Templates

**Created 5 comprehensive templates:**
1. `audit_log_explorer.html` - Main explorer with filters and statistics
2. `audit_log_detail.html` - Detailed view with related logs
3. `retention_policy.html` - Retention management interface
4. `login_attempt_explorer.html` - Login monitoring
5. `data_change_explorer.html` - Data modification tracking
6. `api_request_explorer.html` - API monitoring

**Template Features:**
- Dark mode support
- Responsive design (mobile-friendly)
- Real-time statistics cards
- Advanced filter panels
- Pagination support
- Color-coded severity and status indicators
- Quick action buttons
- Related logs display

## Security Features

1. **Platform Admin Only Access:**
   - All views require `PlatformAdminRequiredMixin`
   - Uses `is_platform_admin()` permission check
   - Login required for all audit views

2. **Retention Policy Safety:**
   - Minimum 30-day retention enforced
   - Confirmation checkbox required
   - All retention executions logged
   - Detailed feedback on deleted counts

3. **Export Limitations:**
   - Maximum 10,000 records per export
   - Filtered exports only (no bulk exports without filters)
   - Error handling for large datasets

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Database Query Optimization:**
   - `select_related()` for foreign keys (user, tenant, content_type)
   - Indexed fields used in filters
   - Pagination (50 records per page)
   - Efficient date range queries

2. **Export Optimization:**
   - Streaming CSV response
   - Limited record count
   - Efficient queryset iteration

## Requirements Satisfied

✅ **Requirement 8.2 - Implement audit log list view with advanced search**
- Comprehensive search across description, user, IP, and path
- Multiple filter options (user, action, category, severity, tenant, IP, date range)
- Quick filter shortcuts for common date ranges

✅ **Requirement 8.2 - Add filters (user, action, date range, tenant, IP)**
- All required filters implemented
- Additional filters for category and severity
- Quick filter options for better UX

✅ **Requirement 8.2 - Create export to CSV functionality**
- Full CSV export with all relevant fields
- Applies current filters to export
- Safety limit of 10,000 records
- Timestamped filenames

✅ **Requirement 8.2 - Implement log retention policies**
- Configurable retention period (minimum 30 days)
- Selective cleanup by log type
- Statistics dashboard showing log age distribution
- Safe execution with confirmation
- Audit trail of retention executions

## Testing

The implementation integrates with existing test suites:
- `apps/core/test_audit_logging.py` - Unit tests for audit logging functions
- `apps/core/test_audit_integration.py` - Integration tests for end-to-end workflows

All existing tests pass without modification, confirming backward compatibility.

## Next Steps

The audit log explorer is now complete and ready for use. Platform administrators can:
1. Access the explorer at `/platform/audit-logs/`
2. Search and filter audit logs with advanced criteria
3. Export filtered logs to CSV for external analysis
4. Manage retention policies to comply with data retention requirements
5. Monitor login attempts, data changes, and API requests separately
