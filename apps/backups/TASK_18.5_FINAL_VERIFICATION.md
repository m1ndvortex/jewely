## Deployment Instructions

### 1. Celery Beat Configuration

Add to `config/celery.py`:

```python
from celery.schedules import crontab

app.conf.beat_schedule = {
    'weekly-tenant-backup': {
        'task': 'apps.backups.tasks.weekly_per_tenant_backup',
        'schedule': crontab(hour=3, minute=0, day_of_week=0),  # Sunday 3:00 AM
        'options': {
            'priority': 9,  # High priority
        },
    },
}
```

### 2. Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in `.env`:

```bash
# Encryption
BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<your-fernet-key>

# Local Storage
BACKUP_LOCAL_PATH=/app/backups

# Cloudflare R2
CLOUDFLARE_R2_ACCOUNT_ID=b7900eeee7c415345d86ea859c9dad47
CLOUDFLARE_R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your-access-key>
CLOUDFLARE_R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your-secret-key>
CLOUDFLARE_R2_BUCKET=securesyntax

# Backblaze B2
BACKBLAZE_B2_KEY_ID=<your-key-id>
BACKBLAZE_B2_APPLICATION_KEY=<your-app-key>
BACKBLAZE_B2_BUCKET=securesyntax
BACKBLAZE_B2_REGION=us-east-005
```

### 3. Start Celery Beat

```bash
docker compose up -d celery_beat
```

### 4. Verify Celery Beat Schedule

```bash
docker compose exec web python manage.py shell
>>> from config.celery import app
>>> app.conf.beat_schedule
```

### 5. Manual Test

```python
from apps.backups.tasks import weekly_per_tenant_backup

# Test with specific tenant
result = weekly_per_tenant_backup(tenant_id='<tenant-uuid>')

# Test with all active tenants
result = weekly_per_tenant_backup()
```

---

## Monitoring

### Check Backup Status

```python
from apps.backups.models import Backup
from apps.core.tenant_context import bypass_rls

with bypass_rls():
    # Get recent tenant backups
    backups = Backup.objects.filter(
        backup_type=Backup.TENANT_BACKUP
    ).order_by('-created_at')[:10]
    
    for backup in backups:
        print(f"{backup.tenant.company_name}: {backup.status} - {backup.created_at}")
```

### Check Backup Alerts

```python
from apps.backups.models import BackupAlert

# Get active alerts
alerts = BackupAlert.objects.filter(
    status=BackupAlert.ACTIVE
).order_by('-created_at')

for alert in alerts:
    print(f"{alert.severity}: {alert.message}")
```
