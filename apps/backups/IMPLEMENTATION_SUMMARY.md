---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Three Core Models (Production-Ready)

#### Backup Model
- **Purpose**: Track all backup operations with comprehensive metadata
- **Features**:
  - Triple-redundant storage paths (local, Cloudflare R2, Backblaze B2)
  - Support for 4 backup types: FULL_DATABASE, TENANT_BACKUP, WAL_ARCHIVE, CONFIGURATION
  - Status tracking: IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETED/FAILED → VERIFIED
  - Performance metrics: compression_ratio, backup_duration_seconds
  - Integrity verification: SHA-256 checksums
  - Metadata storage: JSON field for flexible data
- **Database**: 18 columns, 4 indexes, UUID primary key

#### BackupRestoreLog Model
- **Purpose**: Complete audit trail of all restore operations
- **Features**:
  - Support for 3 restore modes: FULL, MERGE, PITR
  - Performance tracking: rows_restored, duration_seconds
  - Error tracking: error_message, status
  - PITR support: target_timestamp for point-in-time recovery
  - Selective restore: tenant_ids for multi-tenant restore
  - Justification: reason field for compliance
- **Database**: 11 columns, 3 indexes, UUID primary key

#### BackupAlert Model
- **Purpose**: Monitor backup health and send notifications
- **Features**:
  - 6 alert types: BACKUP_FAILURE, SIZE_DEVIATION, DURATION_THRESHOLD, STORAGE_CAPACITY, INTEGRITY_FAILURE, RESTORE_FAILURE
  - 4 severity levels: INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
  - Multi-channel notifications: email, SMS, in-app, webhook
  - Alert lifecycle: ACTIVE → ACKNOWLEDGED → RESOLVED
  - Detailed tracking: acknowledged_by, resolved_by, resolution_notes
- **Database**: 16 columns, 4 indexes, UUID primary key

### 2. Database Schema (Production-Ready)

**Tables Created:**
- `backups_backup` - 18 columns
- `backups_restore_log` - 11 columns
