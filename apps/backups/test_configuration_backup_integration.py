REAL Integration tests for configuration backup functionality.

These tests use REAL storage backends (local, R2, B2) - NO MOCKS ALLOWED.
Tests verify the backup can actually be created, uploaded, and restored.

Requirements tested:
- Requirement 6, Acceptance Criteria 11: Backup configuration files daily at 4:00 AM
- Requirement 6, Acceptance Criteria 12: Create tar.gz archives preserving directory structure
