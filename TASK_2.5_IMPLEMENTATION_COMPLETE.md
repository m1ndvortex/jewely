## Next Steps

Task 2.5 is complete. The next task in the specification is:

**Task 2.6**: Create bill management templates (frontend)

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test bill creation with multiple line items
2. Verify journal entries are created correctly

7. Test validation (dates, amounts, balances)
8. Test with different payment methods

## Notes

- All journal entries are auto-posted for bills and payments
- Bill status automatically updates based on payments
- Bill numbers are auto-generated if not provided
- Forms use TailwindCSS classes for styling
