YOUR ENTERPRISE BACKUP & DISASTER RECOVERY SYSTEM - COMPLETE EXPLANATION
Your system has a military-grade, triple-redundant backup system with automated disaster recovery. Here's exactly how it works:

🎯 OVERVIEW: Triple Storage Redundancy
Every backup is stored in 3 locations simultaneously:

Local Storage (30-day retention) - Fast access for quick restores
Cloudflare R2 (1-year retention) - Primary cloud storage with zero egress fees
Backblaze B2 (1-year retention) - Secondary cloud backup for redundancy
Your Storage Credentials:

Cloudflare R2: Account ID b7900eeee7c415345d86ea859c9dad47, Bucket securesyntax
Backblaze B2: Bucket securesyntax, Region us-east-005
🔄 BACKUP TYPES & SCHEDULES
1. Daily Full Database Backup (2:00 AM)
What happens:

2:00 AM → Celery task triggers
↓
Step 1: pg_dump creates full PostgreSQL backup
↓
Step 2: Compress with gzip level 9 (70-90% size reduction)
↓
Step 3: Encrypt with AES-256 (military-grade encryption)
↓
Step 4: Calculate SHA-256 checksum (verify integrity)
↓
Step 5: Upload to Local + R2 + B2 simultaneously
↓
Step 6: Verify checksums match across all 3 locations
↓
Step 7: Record metadata in database (size, checksum, paths)
↓
Step 8: Cleanup temp files
↓
DONE: Backup stored in 3 locations with verified integrity
Retention:

Local: 30 days (then auto-deleted)
R2 & B2: 1 year (then archived)
2. Weekly Per-Tenant Backup (Sunday 3:00 AM)
What happens:

Sunday 3:00 AM → Celery task triggers
↓
For EACH active tenant:
  ↓
  Set tenant context (RLS filtering)
  ↓
  Export ONLY that tenant's data (inventory, sales, CRM, accounting)
  ↓
  Compress → Encrypt → Checksum
  ↓
  Upload to Local + R2 + B2
  ↓
  Tag with tenant_id
  ↓
  Record in database
↓
DONE: Each tenant has isolated backup
Why this matters:

You can restore individual tenants without affecting others
Tenant data is completely isolated
Perfect for tenant-specific issues or data recovery requests
3. Continuous Point-in-Time Recovery (Every 5 Minutes)
What happens:

Every 5 minutes → Celery task checks for new WAL files
↓
PostgreSQL generates WAL (Write-Ahead Log) files
↓
Compress WAL files
↓
Upload to R2 + B2 (skip local to save space)
↓
Mark as archived
Retention:

Local: 7 days
R2 & B2: 30 days
What this enables:

Restore to ANY moment within last 30 days
5-minute granularity - minimal data loss
Example: "Restore database to exactly 2:37 PM yesterday"
How PITR works:

1. Start with base backup (daily full backup)
2. Replay WAL files from base backup to target time
3. Database state reconstructed to exact moment
4. Configuration Backup (4:00 AM Daily)
What happens:

4:00 AM → Celery task triggers
↓
Collect all config files:
  - docker-compose.yml files
  - .env files (encrypted)
  - nginx.conf
  - SSL certificates
  - Kubernetes manifests
↓
Create tar.gz archive
↓
Encrypt → Checksum
↓
Upload to Local + R2 + B2
Why this matters:

Complete system reconstruction from scratch
Disaster recovery includes infrastructure, not just data
Can rebuild entire system in new environment
5. Flexible Tenant Backup (Manual/On-Demand)
Admin can trigger:

Specific tenant(s): Select one or more tenants
Multiple tenants: Bulk backup
All tenants: Full tenant backup
Immediate or scheduled: Run now or schedule for later
Restore options:

Full restore: Replace existing data (destructive)
Merge restore: Preserve existing data (non-destructive)
Selective restore: Choose which tenants to restore

🎯 REAL-WORLD SCENARIOS
Scenario 1: Tenant accidentally deletes data

1. Admin goes to backup management
2. Selects tenant-specific backup from last night
3. Chooses "Merge restore" (preserve other data)
4. Selects affected tenant
5. Confirms restore
6. System restores only that tenant's data
7. Other tenants unaffected
Scenario 2: Need data from 3 days ago at 2:30 PM

1. Admin selects PITR restore
2. Chooses date/time: 3 days ago, 2:30 PM
3. System finds base backup before that time
4. Replays WAL files to exact moment
5. Database restored to 2:30 PM state
6. Max 5-minute granularity
Scenario 3: Complete system failure

1. Monitoring detects failure
2. Automated DR runbook triggers
3. Downloads latest backup from R2
4. Decrypts and restores database
5. Restarts application pods
6. Verifies health
7. Reroutes traffic
8. System operational in < 1 hour
9. Max 15 minutes data loss
Scenario 4: Cloudflare R2 goes down

1. System detects R2 unavailable
2. Automatically fails over to Backblaze B2
3. Downloads backup from B2 instead
4. Restore continues normally
5. No manual intervention needed

Triple Redundancy: Never lose data - 3 copies always
Automated: No manual intervention needed
Fast Recovery: 1-hour RTO for complete system
Minimal Data Loss: 15-minute RPO
Tenant Isolation: Restore individual tenants
Point-in-Time: Restore to any moment (30 days)
Encrypted: Military-grade AES-256
Verified: SHA-256 checksums ensure integrity
