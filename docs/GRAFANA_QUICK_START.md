docker-compose ps prometheus

# Check Prometheus targets
curl http://localhost:9090/api/v1/targets
```

**Check Data Source**:
1. Go to Configuration ‚Üí Data Sources
2. Click "Prometheus"
3. Click "Test" button
4. Should show "Data source is working"

### Grafana Won't Start

```bash
# Check logs
docker-compose logs grafana

# Restart Grafana
docker-compose restart grafana

# Check port 3000 is not in use
sudo lsof -i :3000
```

### Dashboard Errors

**"No data"**:
- Check time range (might be too far in past)
- Check Prometheus is collecting metrics
- Verify metric name is correct

**"Query timeout"**:
- Reduce time range
- Simplify query
- Check Prometheus performance
