# Task 2.8: Supplier Statement Report - UI Testing Complete ✅

## Testing Summary

Successfully tested the supplier statement report implementation using Playwright browser automation. All features are working correctly through the UI.

## Bug Fixed During Testing

### Issue Found
- **Error:** `type object 'AuditLog' has no attribute 'ACTION_EXPORT'`
- **Location:** `apps/accounting/views.py` line 1776
- **Cause:** Used `AuditLog.ACTION_EXPORT` which doesn't exist in the AuditLog model

### Fix Applied
- **Changed:** `action=AuditLog.ACTION_EXPORT`
- **To:** `action=AuditLog.ACTION_API_GET`
- **Rationale:** ACTION_API_GET is appropriate for data retrieval/export operations
