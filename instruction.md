Project Prompt: Enterprise Multi-Tenant SaaS for Jewelry Management

1. Introduction & Executive Summary

This document defines the requirements for a comprehensive, enterprise-grade, multi-tenant B2B SaaS platform for gold and jewelry shop management. The system is designed to serve 500-10,000+ jewelry shop tenants.

The platform is a "business-in-a-box" solution, providing sophisticated inventory management, full double-entry accounting, point-of-sale (POS), customer relationship management (CRM), and repair/custom order tracking.

The system is architected for security, scalability, and a modern user experience, featuring data isolation via RLS, dual-language support (English/Persian), and dual-theme (light/dark) capabilities.

1.1. Development Philosophy: Library-First

To accelerate development, reduce bugs, and leverage community best practices, this project will adhere to a "Django library-first" approach. For any given feature, we will first research and implement a well-maintained, popular Django library before writing custom code.

2. Core Platform Requirements (Global)

These requirements apply to the entire application, a-la-carte of any specific panel.

    Core Technology Stack & Libraries:

        Backend: Django 4.2+

        Frontend: Django Templates + HTMX + Alpine.js + Tailwind CSS + Flowbite

        Database: PostgreSQL 15+

        Caching: Redis 7+

        Task Queue: Celery (with Redis Broker)

        Deployment: Docker + Kubernetes + Nginx

        Storage: Cloudflare R2 (primary) + Backblaze B2 (backup)

        Core Libraries:

            Multi-Tenancy: Custom RLS policies managed via Django middleware.

            Authentication: django-allauth (Social), django-argon2 (Hashing), djangorestframework-simplejwt (Tokens), django-otp (MFA).

            Admin: django-hijack (Impersonation).

            Translations: django-rosetta (Managing translation files).

    Architecture:

        Multi-Tenancy (Requirement 1): Secure multi-tenant architecture using PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS). Each tenant's data MUST be isolated at the database layer.

    Localization (i18n):

        Dual Language: Support English (LTR) and Persian (RTL).

    Theming:

        Dual Theme: Support Light Mode and Dark Mode.

3. Module A: Admin Panel (SaaS Operator)

This panel is used by the platform administrators with full control over the service and its tenants.

    3.1. Admin Dashboard

        Purpose: A high-level overview of the entire platform's health.

        Components: Real-time charts of tenant signups, revenue metrics, system load, and error feeds.

    3.2. Tenant Lifecycle Management (Full CRUD)

        Purpose: To provide administrators with complete, granular control over every tenant account.

        Features:

            Tenant Creation: Manually create new tenant accounts directly from the admin panel.

            List & Search: View, search, and filter all tenants by status (Active, Suspended, Pending Deletion), subscription plan, or registration date.

            Full Update Control:

                Modify core tenant information (e.g., company name, primary contact).

                Manage a tenant's associated user accounts, including changing usernames or roles.

                Initiate password resets for tenant users (admins should not be able to view or set passwords directly for security).

            Status & Lifecycle Control: Change tenant status between Active, Suspended (access disabled, data retained), and Scheduled for Deletion (grace period before data is purged).

            Impersonation: Secure "login as tenant" functionality for support and debugging, implemented using django-hijack with a clear audit trail.

    3.3. Billing & Subscription Management

                Manual Assignment: Manually assign or change a tenant's subscription plan at any time.

                Limit Overrides: Freely override the default plan limits for a specific tenant (e.g., grant extra user seats to a valued customer without changing their plan).

                Manual Status Control: Manually activate or deactivate a tenant's subscription, overriding the automated status from the payment gateway. This is for handling exceptions, support issues, or policy violations.

        Implementation: Use custom models for plan definitions, integrated with dj-stripe (or equivalent) for payment processing and automated lifecycle events.
