# Storage Backends Implementation Summary

## Overview

Implemented task 18.2: Storage backends for the enterprise backup system with triple-redundant storage support.

## Implementation Date

October 25, 2025

## Components Implemented

### 1. Storage Backend Module (`apps/backups/storage.py`)

Created a comprehensive storage backend system with three implementations:

#### Base Class: `StorageBackend`
- Abstract base class defining the common interface
- Methods: `upload()`, `download()`, `exists()`, `delete()`, `get_size()`

#### LocalStorage Backend
- **Purpose**: Local filesystem storage with 30-day retention
- **Features**:
  - Automatic directory creation
  - File copy operations with metadata preservation
  - Size tracking
  - Configurable base path (defaults to `/var/backups/jewelry-shop`)
- **Use Case**: Quick access and first line of backup storage

#### CloudflareR2Storage Backend
- **Purpose**: Cloudflare R2 object storage with 1-year retention
- **Configuration**:
  - Account ID: `b7900eeee7c415345d86ea859c9dad47`
  - Bucket: `securesyntax`
  - Endpoint: `https://b7900eeee7c415345d86ea859c9dad47.r2.cloudflarestorage.com`
- **Features**:
  - S3-compatible API using boto3
  - Automatic metadata tagging
  - Error handling with ClientError
  - Support for all CRUD operations
- **Use Case**: Primary cloud storage with fast access

#### BackblazeB2Storage Backend
- **Purpose**: Backblaze B2 object storage with 1-year retention
- **Configuration**:
  - Bucket: `securesyntax`
  - Region: `us-east-005`
  - Endpoint: `https://s3.us-east-005.backblazeb2.com`
  - Bucket ID: `2a0cfb4aa9f8f8f29c820b18`
- **Features**:
  - S3-compatible API using boto3
  - Automatic metadata tagging
  - Error handling with ClientError
  - Support for all CRUD operations
- **Use Case**: Secondary cloud storage for redundancy

#### Factory Function: `get_storage_backend()`
- **Purpose**: Factory function to instantiate storage backends
- **Parameters**: `backend_type` ('local', 'r2', or 'b2')
- **Features**: Case-insensitive backend type matching
- **Returns**: Instance of the requested storage backend

### 2. Dependencies Added

Added to `requirements.txt`:
```
boto3==1.34.51
```

### 3. Test Suite (`apps/backups/test_storage.py`)

Comprehensive test coverage with 35 tests:

#### LocalStorage Tests (11 tests)
- Directory creation
- File upload with parent directory creation
- File download
- File existence checking
- File deletion (including idempotent deletion)
- File size retrieval
- Error handling for non-existent files

#### CloudflareR2Storage Tests (11 tests)
- Client initialization with correct configuration
- File upload with metadata
- File download
- File existence checking via head_object
- File deletion
- File size retrieval
- Error handling for ClientError exceptions
- Failure scenarios (upload, download, delete)

#### BackblazeB2Storage Tests (8 tests)
- Client initialization with correct configuration
- File upload with metadata
- File download
- File existence checking
- File deletion
- File size retrieval
- Error handling for ClientError exceptions

#### Factory Function Tests (5 tests)
- Backend instantiation for all types
- Case-insensitive backend type matching
- Invalid backend type error handling

### 4. Test Results

**All 35 tests passed successfully:**
- LocalStorage: 11/11 passed (100%)
- CloudflareR2Storage: 11/11 passed (100%)
- BackblazeB2Storage: 8/8 passed (100%)
- Factory Function: 5/5 passed (100%)

**Code Coverage:**
- `apps/backups/storage.py`: 74% coverage
- Missing coverage is primarily in error handling paths that are difficult to trigger in tests

## Key Features

### 1. Unified Interface
All storage backends implement the same interface, making them interchangeable:
```python
storage = get_storage_backend('local')  # or 'r2' or 'b2'
storage.upload(local_path, remote_path)
storage.download(remote_path, local_path)
storage.exists(remote_path)
storage.delete(remote_path)
storage.get_size(remote_path)
```

### 2. Error Handling
- Comprehensive error handling for all operations
- Graceful degradation on failures
- Detailed logging for debugging
- Returns boolean success/failure for operations

### 3. Logging
- Structured logging throughout
- Info level for successful operations
- Error level for failures
- Debug level for existence checks

### 4. Configuration
All backends support configuration via:
- Constructor parameters (for testing)
- Django settings (for production)
- Sensible defaults

### 5. Testing Strategy
- LocalStorage: Real filesystem operations (no mocking)
- Cloud Storage: Mocked boto3 client (external service)
- Follows project testing guidelines: mock external services only

## Configuration Requirements

### Environment Variables

For production use, add these to `.env`:

```bash
# Local Storage
BACKUP_LOCAL_PATH=/var/backups/jewelry-shop

# Cloudflare R2
R2_ACCOUNT_ID=b7900eeee7c415345d86ea859c9dad47
R2_BUCKET_NAME=securesyntax
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_r2_access_key
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_r2_secret_key

# Backblaze B2
B2_BUCKET_NAME=securesyntax
B2_REGION=us-east-005
B2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_b2_access_key
B2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_b2_secret_key
```

### Django Settings

Add to `config/settings.py`:

```python
# Backup Storage Configuration
BACKUP_LOCAL_PATH = os.getenv('BACKUP_LOCAL_PATH', '/var/backups/jewelry-shop')

# Cloudflare R2 Configuration
R2_ACCOUNT_ID = os.getenv('R2_ACCOUNT_ID', 'b7900eeee7c415345d86ea859c9dad47')
R2_BUCKET_NAME = os.getenv('R2_BUCKET_NAME', 'securesyntax')
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.getenv('R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID', '')
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.getenv('R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY', '')

# Backblaze B2 Configuration
B2_BUCKET_NAME = os.getenv('B2_BUCKET_NAME', 'securesyntax')
B2_REGION = os.getenv('B2_REGION', 'us-east-005')
B2_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.getenv('B2_ACCESS_KEY_ID', '')
B2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.getenv('B2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY', '')
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Upload to All Three Backends

```python
from apps.backups.storage import LocalStorage, CloudflareR2Storage, BackblazeB2Storage

# Initialize backends
local = LocalStorage()
r2 = CloudflareR2Storage()
b2 = BackblazeB2Storage()

# Upload to all three locations
local_path = "/tmp/backup.sql.gz.enc"
remote_path = "backups/full/2025/10/backup.sql.gz.enc"

local.upload(local_path, remote_path)
r2.upload(local_path, remote_path)
b2.upload(local_path, remote_path)
```

### Using Factory Function

```python
from apps.backups.storage import get_storage_backend

# Get backend by type
storage = get_storage_backend('r2')
storage.upload(local_path, remote_path)
```

### Triple-Redundant Upload

```python
from apps.backups.storage import get_storage_backend

def upload_to_all_backends(local_path, remote_path):
    """Upload file to all three storage backends."""
    backends = ['local', 'r2', 'b2']
    results = {}
    
    for backend_type in backends:
        storage = get_storage_backend(backend_type)
        success = storage.upload(local_path, remote_path)
        results[backend_type] = success
    
    return results
```

## Next Steps

The following tasks depend on this implementation:

1. **Task 18.3**: Implement backup encryption and compression
   - Will use these storage backends to upload encrypted backups

2. **Task 18.4**: Implement daily full database backup
   - Will use all three backends for triple-redundant storage

3. **Task 18.5**: Implement weekly per-tenant backup
   - Will use storage backends for tenant-specific backups

4. **Task 18.6**: Implement continuous WAL archiving
   - Will use R2 and B2 backends (skip local for WAL files)

## Requirements Satisfied

This implementation satisfies the following requirements from Requirement 6:

- ✅ **6.1**: Store every backup in three locations simultaneously
- ✅ **6.34**: Use Cloudflare R2 credentials (Account ID, Bucket, Endpoint)
- ✅ **6.35**: Use Backblaze B2 credentials (Bucket, Region, Endpoint, Bucket ID)

## Technical Decisions

### Why boto3?
- Industry-standard S3-compatible client
- Well-maintained and documented
- Works with both Cloudflare R2 and Backblaze B2
- Supports all required operations

### Why separate classes instead of one generic S3 class?
- Clear separation of concerns
- Different configuration for each provider
- Easier to add provider-specific features later
- Better logging and error messages

### Why not use Django's storage backends?
- Need more control over upload/download process
- Need to support multiple simultaneous uploads
- Need custom error handling and retry logic
- Django storage is designed for media files, not backups

## Performance Considerations

### Upload Performance
- Local: Very fast (disk I/O limited)
- R2: Fast (Cloudflare's global network)
- B2: Moderate (depends on region)

### Download Performance
- Local: Very fast (disk I/O limited)
- R2: Fast (Cloudflare's global network)
- B2: Moderate (depends on region)

### Recommendations
- Use local storage for quick restores
- Use R2 as primary cloud storage (faster)
- Use B2 as secondary cloud storage (cost-effective)

## Security Considerations

1. **Credentials**: Store in environment variables, never in code
2. **Encryption**: Files should be encrypted before upload (Task 18.3)
3. **Access Control**: Use IAM policies to restrict bucket access
4. **Logging**: All operations are logged for audit trail

## Monitoring

The storage backends log all operations:
- Info: Successful uploads, downloads, deletes
- Error: Failed operations with details
- Debug: Existence checks

Integrate with your logging system to monitor:
- Upload success rates
- Download times
- Storage failures
- Disk space usage

## Conclusion

Task 18.2 is complete with:
- ✅ LocalStorage class implemented
- ✅ CloudflareR2Storage class implemented
- ✅ BackblazeB2Storage class implemented
- ✅ All required methods (upload, download, exists, delete) implemented
- ✅ Factory function for backend instantiation
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite (35 tests, all passing)
- ✅ boto3 dependency added
- ✅ Documentation complete

The storage backend system is ready for use in the backup tasks (18.3-18.15).
