# Pre-commit Hooks - Working Implementation ‚úÖ

## Overview

Pre-commit hooks are now **fully functional** and will automatically run code quality checks on every `git commit`.

## What Was Fixed

### Initial Problem
- Pre-commit hooks were configured but not installed
- The `pre-commit` package was missing from requirements.txt
- Hooks couldn't run because they need to execute inside Docker containers

### Solution Implemented
1. ‚úÖ Added `pre-commit==3.6.2` to requirements.txt
2. ‚úÖ Created custom `.git/hooks/pre-commit` script
3. ‚úÖ Script runs checks via Docker containers
4. ‚úÖ Hooks automatically block commits if checks fail
5. ‚úÖ Clear error messages with fix instructions

## How It Works

### Automatic Execution
When you run `git commit`, the pre-commit hook automatically:

1. **Checks if Docker is running**
   - If not, shows a warning and allows commit (for flexibility)

2. **Runs Black formatter check**
   ```bash
   docker compose exec -T web black --check .
   ```

3. **Runs isort import sorting check**
   ```bash
   docker compose exec -T web isort --check-only .
   ```

4. **Runs Flake8 linting**
   ```bash
   docker compose exec -T web flake8 .
   ```

5. **Blocks commit if any check fails**
   - Shows which check failed
   - Provides command to fix the issue
   - Prevents bad code from being committed

### Example: Successful Commit

```bash
$ git commit -m "feat: Add new feature"
Running pre-commit checks via Docker...
üîç Running black...
All done! ‚ú® üç∞ ‚ú®
17 files would be left unchanged.
üîç Running isort...
Skipped 1 files
üîç Running flake8...
‚úÖ All pre-commit checks passed!
[main abc1234] feat: Add new feature
 1 file changed, 10 insertions(+)
```

### Example: Failed Commit (Bad Formatting)

```bash
$ git commit -m "feat: Add badly formatted code"
Running pre-commit checks via Docker...
üîç Running black...
would reformat /app/my_file.py

Oh no! üí• üíî üí•
1 file would be reformatted, 17 files would be left unchanged.
‚ùå Black formatting check failed!
   Fix with: docker compose exec web black .
```

## Checks Performed

### 1. Black - Code Formatting
- Ensures consistent code formatting
- Line length: 100 characters
- Follows PEP 8 style guide

### 2. isort - Import Sorting
- Organizes imports alphabetically
- Groups imports by type (stdlib, third-party, local)
- Compatible with Black formatting

### 3. Flake8 - Code Linting
- Checks for Python syntax errors
- Enforces PEP 8 style conventions
- Detects unused imports and variables
- Maximum line length: 100 characters

## Manual Commands

If you need to run checks or fixes manually:

```bash
# Format code with Black
docker compose exec web black .

# Sort imports with isort
docker compose exec web isort .

# Check linting with Flake8
docker compose exec web flake8 .

# Run all checks (via Makefile)
make lint

# Format all code (via Makefile)
make format
```

## For New Developers

The pre-commit hook is already installed in `.git/hooks/pre-commit`.

If you clone the repository fresh:

1. The hook file is in `.git/hooks/pre-commit` (tracked in git)
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit`
3. Or run the setup script: `./setup.sh`

## Testing the Hooks

To verify hooks are working:

```bash
# Create a badly formatted file
echo "def bad(  ):" > test.py
echo "    x=1+2" >> test.py

# Try to commit it
git add test.py
git commit -m "test"

# Should see:
# ‚ùå Black formatting check failed!
# Fix with: docker compose exec web black .

# Clean up
git reset HEAD test.py
rm test.py
```

## Benefits

‚úÖ **Prevents bad code from being committed**
- No more "fix formatting" commits
- Consistent code style across the team
- Catches errors before they reach the repository

‚úÖ **Automatic enforcement**
- No need to remember to run checks
- Works for all developers
- Integrated into normal git workflow

‚úÖ **Clear feedback**
- Shows exactly what failed
- Provides fix commands
- Fast feedback loop

‚úÖ **Docker-based**
- No need to install tools on host machine
- Consistent environment for all developers
- Works on any OS (Linux, macOS, Windows)

## Troubleshooting

### Hooks not running?
```bash
# Check if hook file exists and is executable
ls -la .git/hooks/pre-commit
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

### Docker not running?
```bash
# Start Docker services
docker compose up -d

# Verify services are running
docker compose ps
```

### Want to skip hooks temporarily?
```bash
# Use --no-verify flag (not recommended)
git commit --no-verify -m "emergency fix"
```

## Files Involved

- `.git/hooks/pre-commit` - The hook script
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` - Configuration (for reference)
- `requirements.txt` - Includes pre-commit package
- `pyproject.toml` - Tool configurations
- `setup.cfg` - Flake8 and mypy config

## Status

‚úÖ **FULLY WORKING**
- Tested with successful commits
- Tested with failed commits (bad formatting)
- Integrated with Docker workflow
- Documented for team use
