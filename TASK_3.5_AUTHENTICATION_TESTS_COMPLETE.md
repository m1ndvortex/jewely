## Summary

Successfully implemented comprehensive authentication and authorization tests covering all requirements from Task 3.5.

## Test Coverage

### Total Tests: 129 tests passed
- **test_authentication.py**: 31 tests (existing)

- **test_auth_comprehensive.py**: 49 tests (new)

## Test Categories Implemented

### 1. Login Flow Tests (6 tests)
✅ Test successful login with valid credentials returns JWT tokens and user info
✅ Test login with invalid username fails
✅ Test login with wrong password fails
✅ Test login with empty credentials fails
✅ Test login with missing password field fails
✅ Test login using email as username

### 2. JWT Token Generation and Validation (6 tests)
✅ Test JWT token contains custom claims (username, email, role, tenant_id, language, theme)
✅ Test accessing protected endpoint with valid token
✅ Test accessing protected endpoint without token fails
✅ Test accessing protected endpoint with invalid token fails
✅ Test refresh token generates new access token
✅ Test invalid refresh token fails

### 3. MFA Flow Tests (10 tests)
✅ Test MFA enable flow creates device and returns QR code
✅ Test MFA confirm with correct token
✅ Test MFA confirm with incorrect token fails
✅ Test login with MFA requires token
✅ Test login with MFA and correct token succeeds
✅ Test login with MFA and incorrect token fails
✅ Test MFA disable with correct password
✅ Test MFA disable with incorrect password fails
✅ Test MFA status check for users with/without MFA
✅ Test MFA verification during login

### 4. Role-Based Access Control Tests (12 tests)
✅ Test platform admin role identification
✅ Test tenant owner role identification
✅ Test tenant manager role identification
✅ Test tenant employee role identification
✅ Test owner can manage users
✅ Test manager can manage users
✅ Test employee cannot manage users
✅ Test owner can manage inventory
✅ Test manager can manage inventory
✅ Test employee cannot manage inventory
✅ Test all tenant users can process sales
✅ Test platform admin cannot process sales

### 5. Permission Enforcement Tests (5 tests)
✅ Test unauthenticated user cannot access protected endpoints
✅ Test authenticated user can access own profile
✅ Test user can update own profile
✅ Test user can change preferences (language, theme)
✅ Test user can change password

### 6. Additional Security Tests
✅ Test tenant isolation (users from different tenants)
✅ Test JWT token contains correct tenant ID
✅ Test password uses Argon2 hashing
✅ Test weak passwords are rejected
✅ Test strong passwords are accepted
✅ Test platform admin MFA requirement
✅ Test tenant users do not require MFA
✅ Test branch-based access control
✅ Test user model constraints

### 7. Permission Classes and Decorators (from test_permissions.py)
✅ Test role-based decorators (role_required, platform_admin_required, etc.)
✅ Test permission classes (IsPlatformAdmin, IsTenantOwner, etc.)
✅ Test object-level permissions (IsSameTenant, IsOwnerOrReadOnly)
✅ Test django-guardian integration
✅ Test permission mixins (RoleRequiredMixin, TenantFilterMixin)
✅ Test utility functions (check_role_permission, check_tenant_access)
✅ Test permission groups setup
✅ Test branch-based permissions
✅ Test permission audit logging

## Test Execution Results

```bash
docker compose exec web pytest tests/test_authentication.py tests/test_permissions.py tests/test_auth_comprehensive.py -v

============================= 129 passed in 11.80s =============================
```

## Code Coverage

- **apps/core/models.py**: 88% coverage
- **apps/core/views.py**: 89% coverage
- **apps/core/serializers.py**: 91% coverage
- **apps/core/permissions.py**: 77% coverage
- **apps/core/audit.py**: 91% coverage

## Key Features Tested

### Authentication
- JWT token generation with custom claims
- Token refresh mechanism
- Login with username or email
- Password validation and hashing (Argon2)
- Password change functionality

### Multi-Factor Authentication
- MFA device creation and QR code generation
- Token verification during login
- MFA enable/disable flow
- Platform admin MFA requirement

### Authorization
- Role-based permissions (Platform Admin, Tenant Owner, Manager, Employee)
- Object-level permissions with django-guardian
- Tenant isolation enforcement
- Branch-based access control
- Permission audit logging

### Security
- Unauthenticated access prevention
- Invalid token rejection
- Password complexity enforcement
- Tenant data isolation
- Branch assignment validation

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `tests/test_auth_comprehensive.py` - 49 comprehensive authentication and authorization tests

### Existing Files (Enhanced Coverage)
- `tests/test_authentication.py` - 31 tests for JWT, MFA, and password management
- `tests/test_permissions.py` - 49 tests for role-based and object-level permissions

## Testing Best Practices Followed

1. ✅ **Real Database Testing**: All tests use real PostgreSQL database in Docker (no mocking internal services)
2. ✅ **Fixture-Based Setup**: Reusable fixtures for tenants, users, and branches
3. ✅ **Descriptive Test Names**: Clear test names describing what is being tested
4. ✅ **Comprehensive Coverage**: Tests cover success cases, failure cases, and edge cases
5. ✅ **Isolated Tests**: Each test is independent and can run in any order
6. ✅ **Assertion Clarity**: Clear assertions with meaningful error messages
7. ✅ **Docker-Only Execution**: All tests run inside Docker containers

## Next Steps

Task 3.5 is now complete. The authentication and authorization system has comprehensive test coverage including:
- Login flow with valid/invalid credentials ✅
- JWT token generation and validation ✅
- MFA flow ✅
- Role-based access control ✅
- Permission enforcement ✅

All 129 tests pass successfully, providing confidence in the authentication and authorization implementation.
