   - Product search results cached client-side
   - Customer search results cached client-side

### User Experience

   - Auto-focus on search input
   - Enter key triggers search
   - Tab navigation supported

2. **Visual Feedback:**
   - Loading states for async operations
   - Error messages for validation failures
