## Troubleshooting

### Requirements Clarification Stalls

If the requirements clarification process seems to be going in circles or not making progress:

- The model SHOULD suggest moving to a different aspect of the requirements
- The model MAY provide examples or options to help the user make decisions
- The model SHOULD summarize what has been established so far and identify specific gaps
- The model MAY suggest conducting research to inform requirements decisions

### Research Limitations

If the model cannot access needed information:

- The model SHOULD document what information is missing
- The model SHOULD suggest alternative approaches based on available information
- The model MAY ask the user to provide additional context or documentation
- The model SHOULD continue with available information rather than blocking progress

### Design Complexity

If the design becomes too complex or unwieldy:

- The model SHOULD suggest breaking it down into smaller, more manageable components
- The model SHOULD focus on core functionality first
- The model MAY suggest a phased approach to implementation
- The model SHOULD return to requirements clarification to prioritize features if needed
