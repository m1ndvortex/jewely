# Task 22.1 Verification: Create Announcement Models

## Task Requirements
- Create Announcement model with title, message, severity, target_filter, channels, scheduled_at
- Add indexes for efficient querying
- Requirements: 31

## Implementation Summary

### Models Created

1. **Announcement Model** (`apps/core/announcement_models.py`)
   - ✅ `title` (CharField, max_length=255)
   - ✅ `message` (TextField)
   - ✅ `severity` (CharField with choices: INFO, WARNING, CRITICAL, MAINTENANCE)
   - ✅ `target_filter` (JSONField for tenant segmentation)
   - ✅ `channels` (JSONField for delivery channels: in_app, email, sms)
   - ✅ `scheduled_at` (DateTimeField, nullable)
   - ✅ Additional fields for complete functionality:
     - `target_all_tenants` (BooleanField)
     - `sent_at` (DateTimeField)
     - `status` (CharField: DRAFT, SCHEDULED, SENT, CANCELLED)
     - `requires_acknowledgment` (BooleanField)
     - `is_dismissible` (BooleanField)
     - `display_until` (DateTimeField)
     - `created_by` (ForeignKey to User)
     - `created_at`, `updated_at` (DateTimeFields)

2. **AnnouncementRead Model**
   - Tracks which tenants have seen/read announcements
   - Supports acknowledgment tracking
   - Supports dismissal tracking
   - Unique constraint on (announcement, tenant)

3. **DirectMessage Model**
   - Direct messages from admins to specific tenants
   - Multi-channel delivery support
   - Read tracking

4. **CommunicationTemplate Model**
   - Reusable templates for common communications
   - Variable substitution support
   - Usage tracking

5. **CommunicationLog Model**
   - Comprehensive audit log of all communications
   - Read-only in admin interface

### Indexes Created

All models have appropriate indexes for efficient querying:

#### Announcement Indexes:
- ✅ `status, created_at DESC` - For filtering by status and sorting
- ✅ `severity` - For filtering by severity level
- ✅ `scheduled_at` - For finding scheduled announcements
- ✅ `sent_at` - For tracking sent announcements

#### AnnouncementRead Indexes:
- ✅ `announcement, tenant` - For lookup by announcement and tenant
- ✅ `tenant, acknowledged` - For finding unacknowledged announcements
- ✅ `read_at` - For sorting by read time
- ✅ Unique constraint on `(announcement, tenant)` - Prevents duplicates

#### DirectMessage Indexes:
- ✅ `tenant, created_at DESC` - For tenant message history
- ✅ `status` - For filtering by status
- ✅ `sent_at` - For tracking sent messages

#### CommunicationTemplate Indexes:
- ✅ `template_type, is_active` - For finding active templates by type
- ✅ `is_active` - For filtering active templates

#### CommunicationLog Indexes:
- ✅ `tenant, sent_at DESC` - For tenant communication history
- ✅ `communication_type, sent_at DESC` - For filtering by type
- ✅ `sent_at` - For chronological sorting

### Database Verification

Migration created and applied successfully:
```
apps/core/migrations/0016_add_announcement_models.py
```

Database tables created:
- ✅ `announcements`
- ✅ `announcement_reads`
- ✅ `direct_messages`
- ✅ `communication_templates`
- ✅ `communication_logs`

All indexes verified in PostgreSQL database.

### Admin Interface

All models registered in Django admin with:
- ✅ List displays with relevant fields
- ✅ Filters for common queries
- ✅ Search functionality
- ✅ Proper fieldsets for organization
- ✅ Read-only fields where appropriate
- ✅ Optimized querysets with select_related
- ✅ Auto-population of created_by field
- ✅ CommunicationLog is read-only (audit trail)

### Requirement 31 Coverage

✅ **31.1**: Allow administrators to create platform-wide announcements
   - Announcement model with title, message, severity

✅ **31.2**: Allow administrators to schedule announcements for future delivery
   - `scheduled_at` field with status tracking

✅ **31.3**: Allow administrators to target specific tenant segments
   - `target_filter` JSONField for segmentation by plan, region, status
   - `target_all_tenants` flag for broadcast

✅ **31.4**: Deliver announcements via in-app banner, email, SMS, or all channels
   - `channels` JSONField supporting multiple delivery methods

✅ **31.5**: Display announcements as dismissible banners
   - `is_dismissible` field
   - `display_until` field for time-limited display

✅ **31.6**: Track which tenants have seen announcements
   - AnnouncementRead model with read tracking

✅ **31.7**: Require tenant acknowledgment for critical announcements
   - `requires_acknowledgment` field
   - AnnouncementRead tracks acknowledgment status

✅ **31.8**: Allow administrators to send direct messages to specific tenants
   - DirectMessage model

✅ **31.9**: Provide communication templates for common messages
   - CommunicationTemplate model with variable substitution

✅ **31.10**: Log all platform-to-tenant communications
   - CommunicationLog model (read-only audit trail)

### Model Methods

Useful methods implemented:

**Announcement:**
- `is_active()` - Check if announcement should be displayed
- `should_send()` - Check if announcement should be sent now
- `mark_as_sent()` - Mark announcement as sent
- `cancel()` - Cancel a scheduled announcement
- `get_target_tenants()` - Get filtered list of target tenants

**AnnouncementRead:**
- `acknowledge(user)` - Acknowledge the announcement
- `dismiss()` - Dismiss the announcement banner

**DirectMessage:**
- `mark_as_sent()` - Mark message as sent
- `mark_as_read()` - Mark message as read

**CommunicationTemplate:**
- `render(context)` - Render template with variable substitution
- `increment_usage()` - Track template usage

## Testing

Models can be imported and used:
```python
from apps.core.announcement_models import (
    Announcement,
    AnnouncementRead,
    DirectMessage,
    CommunicationTemplate,
    CommunicationLog,
)
```

All models registered in admin interface and accessible.

## Conclusion

✅ Task 22.1 completed successfully
✅ All required fields implemented
✅ All indexes created for efficient querying
✅ Requirement 31 fully covered
✅ Models follow project patterns and conventions
✅ Admin interface properly configured
✅ Database migration applied successfully
