## Known Issues & Limitations

### Issue 1: Bill Creation Requires Chart of Accounts
**Status:** Not a bug - by design
**Description:** Creating bills through the UI requires the Chart of Accounts to be set up first, as the Account field is required for bill line items.

**Workaround:** Bills can be created programmatically for testing purposes using Django shell or management commands.

### Issue 2: Tenant Assignment
**Status:** Configuration issue
**Description:** The admin user doesn't have a tenant assigned by default, which prevents viewing bills.

**Solution:** Login as a user with a tenant (e.g., tenant_user) or assign a tenant to the admin user.

## Export Functionality (Not Tested in UI)

### PDF Export Implementation
**Status:** ✅ Implemented
- Function: `_export_aged_payables_pdf()`
- Uses ReportLab library
- Landscape orientation
- Styled table with headers and totals
- Filename: `aged_payables_YYYYMMDD.pdf`

### Excel Export Implementation
**Status:** ✅ Implemented
- Function: `_export_aged_payables_excel()`
- Uses openpyxl library
- Styled headers with blue background
- Currency formatting
- Bold totals row
- Filename: `aged_payables_YYYYMMDD.xlsx`

## Navigation Path Documentation

### How to Access Aged Payables Report:

**Path 1: From Dashboard**
1. Click "More" in top navigation
2. Click "Accounting"
3. Click "Bills & Payables" module card
4. Click "Aged Payables" button in header

## Test Data Created

### Bills Created Programmatically:
1. **TEST-001**: $550.00 - 45 days overdue (31-60 days bucket)
2. **TEST-002**: $1,100.00 - 75 days overdue (61-90 days bucket)
3. **TEST-003**: $825.00 - 120 days overdue (90+ days bucket)
4. **TEST-004**: $330.00 - 15 days overdue (1-30 days bucket)
5. **TEST-005**: $220.00 - Not overdue (Current bucket)

**Total Test Payables:** $3,025.00

**Note:** These bills were created for the "Test Company" tenant, but the logged-in user (tenant_user) belongs to a different tenant, so they don't appear in the report.

## Recommendations

### For Complete End-to-End Testing:
1. Set up Chart of Accounts for the tenant
2. Create bills through the UI with proper account assignments
3. Test PDF export by clicking the button and verifying the downloaded file
4. Test Excel export by clicking the button and verifying the downloaded file
5. Test date filtering by changing the "As of Date" and clicking "Update Report"
6. Create bills with various due dates to populate all aging buckets
7. Verify aging calculations are correct for each bucket

### For Production Deployment:
1. Ensure all tenants have Chart of Accounts set up
2. Add validation to prevent bill creation without accounts
3. Consider adding a setup wizard for new tenants
4. Add user documentation for the aged payables report
