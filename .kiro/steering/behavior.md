When planning how to do something, use the sequentialthinking tool to plan the next several steps.

Each time you start working, before start implementing each task first look at requirements.md related to that task . so you make sure you implemented in completly without miss stomething,
you will verify it one more after task finish too


Each time you start working, put a `user_request`
type entity into the knowledge graph using the `create_entities` tool.
After you work, add observations to that entity
about what you did, how many files you touched, how many lines, etc.

Use kubernate mcp when needed to make things easier

dont create documentation unless user say
