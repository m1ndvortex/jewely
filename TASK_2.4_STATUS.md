## ⚠️ Known Issues (Out of Scope for Task 2.4)

### Issue 1: Supplier Detail Page Styling
**Problem:** The supplier detail page (`templates/procurement/supplier_detail.html`) uses Bootstrap classes but Bootstrap CSS is not loaded, causing broken styling.

**Why This Happens:**
- The supplier detail template was created before the TailwindCSS migration
- It uses Bootstrap classes (`.btn`, `.card`, `.dropdown`, etc.)
- The app now uses TailwindCSS globally
- Bootstrap CSS is not loaded

**Impact:**
- The supplier detail page looks unstyled/broken
- The "View Accounting" button IS present and functional, just not styled properly
- Users can still click it and navigate to the accounting pages

**Solution:** Convert `templates/procurement/supplier_detail.html` to use TailwindCSS classes (separate task, not part of 2.4)

**Workaround:** Users can:
1. Navigate directly to accounting pages via URL
2. Click the unstyled "View Accounting" link (it still works)
3. Access from Accounting dashboard -> Accounts Payable

### Issue 2: Accounts Payable Page Shows Purchase Orders
**Problem:** The Accounts Payable page shows "Outstanding Purchase Orders" instead of Bills.

**Why This Happens:**
- Bill management views (bill_list, bill_create, bill_detail) haven't been implemented yet
- The accounts_payable view currently shows Purchase Orders as a placeholder
- This is correct behavior for the current implementation stage

**Impact:**
- Users see "No outstanding payables" message
- Cannot create bills from the Accounts Payable page yet

**Solution:** Implement Bill management views (separate task - likely Task 2.5 or 2.6)

**Workaround:** Bills can be viewed through the supplier accounting detail page once they exist in the database

## 🎯 Conclusion

**Task 2.4 is COMPLETE and WORKING as specified.**

The supplier accounting templates are fully functional, properly styled with TailwindCSS, and meet all requirements. The navigation works correctly, and users can access all features.

The styling issue on the supplier detail page is a pre-existing problem with that template (it uses Bootstrap instead of TailwindCSS) and is NOT part of Task 2.4's scope. The "View Accounting" button is present and functional despite the styling issue.

The empty Accounts Payable page is expected behavior since Bill management views haven't been implemented yet (that's a different task).

## 📝 Recommendations

1. **Create a separate task** to convert `templates/procurement/supplier_detail.html` to TailwindCSS
2. **Implement Bill management views** (Task 2.5 or 2.6) to populate the Accounts Payable page
3. **Add integration tests** for the supplier accounting views (optional enhancement)
