### 3. RunbookExecution Model
**Purpose**: Track individual runbook executions for audit and analysis

**Key Features**:
- Execution status tracking (In Progress, Completed, Failed, Cancelled)
- Step-by-step progress tracking
- Duration measurement
- Verification results
- Rollback tracking
- Error logging
- Notes and observations
- Links to runbook version at time of execution

**Database Table**: `runbook_executions`

**Indexes**:

### 4. AdminNote Model
**Purpose**: Notes and tips from admins for other admins

**Key Features**:
- Note types (Tip, Warning, Best Practice, Lesson Learned)
- Linkable to documentation pages or runbooks
- Pin functionality for important notes
- Helpful counter for engagement tracking
- Tag-based categorization

**Database Table**: `admin_notes`

**Indexes**:
- Composite indexes on documentation_page/created_at, runbook/created_at, note_type/created_at
- Index on is_pinned/created_at for sorting

## Technical Implementation

### Full-Text Search
Both DocumentationPage and Runbook models include:
- `SearchVectorField` for PostgreSQL full-text search
- GIN indexes for efficient search queries
- Support for searching across title, content, and other text fields

### Admin Interface
All models registered in Django admin with:
- Comprehensive list displays
- Advanced filtering options
- Search functionality
- Readonly fields for audit data
- Organized fieldsets
- Optimized querysets with select_related

### Model Methods

**DocumentationPage**:
- `publish()`: Publish the page
- `archive()`: Archive the page
- `increment_view_count()`: Track page views
- `get_breadcrumbs()`: Generate navigation breadcrumbs

**Runbook**:
- `activate()`: Activate the runbook
- `deprecate()`: Deprecate the runbook
- `record_execution(success)`: Track execution statistics
- `get_success_rate()`: Calculate success rate

**RunbookExecution**:
- `complete(success, notes)`: Mark execution as complete
- `cancel(reason)`: Cancel the execution

**AdminNote**:
- `mark_helpful()`: Increment helpful counter
- `pin()`: Pin the note
- `unpin()`: Unpin the note

## Database Migration

Migration file created: `apps/core/migrations/0025_add_documentation_models.py`

Successfully applied with:
- 4 new tables created
- 19 indexes created (including 2 GIN indexes for full-text search)
- All foreign key relationships established

## Testing

Verified functionality:
✅ Model creation and basic operations
✅ Status transitions (publish, activate, etc.)
✅ Method functionality (mark_helpful, record_execution, etc.)
✅ Success rate calculation
✅ Database table structure
✅ Full-text search indexes
✅ Admin registration

## Files Modified/Created

### Created:
- `apps/core/documentation_models.py` - All documentation models

### Modified:
- `apps/core/models.py` - Added imports for documentation models
- `apps/core/admin.py` - Added admin registrations for all 4 models

### Generated:
- `apps/core/migrations/0025_add_documentation_models.py` - Database migration

## Next Steps

The following tasks in the spec can now be implemented:
- **Task 25.2**: Implement documentation interface (browser, search, editor)
- **Task 25.3**: Create operational runbooks (populate with actual procedures)
- **Task 25.4**: Write documentation tests

## Notes

- All models follow the established patterns from other core models (announcements, webhooks, etc.)
- Full-text search is ready for implementation in the UI
- Models support both English and Persian content (no language restrictions)
- Execution tracking provides valuable metrics for runbook effectiveness
- Admin notes create a collaborative knowledge base for the operations team
