# Nginx Reverse Proxy Horizontal Pod Autoscaler
# ============================================================================
# Automatically scales Nginx reverse proxy pods based on CPU and memory usage.
#
# Scaling Configuration:
# - Min Replicas: 2 (high availability)
# - Max Replicas: 5 (handle peak loads)
# - CPU Threshold: 70%
# - Memory Threshold: 80%
#
# Scaling Behavior:
# - Scale-Up: Moderate (50% increase every 30s)
# - Scale-Down: Gradual (50% decrease every 60s after 3min stabilization)
