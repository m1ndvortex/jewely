# Task 18.8 Completion Report: Flexible Tenant Backup

## Overview
Successfully implemented flexible tenant backup functionality with comprehensive interface for manual backup triggers and restore operations.

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Forms (apps/backups/forms.py)
Created three main forms:

#### ManualBackupForm
- **Backup Scope Options:**
  - All tenants
  - Specific tenant(s)
  - Multiple tenants
- **Execution Timing:**
  - Immediate execution
  - Scheduled execution with datetime picker
- **Additional Options:**
  - Include configuration files
  - Optional notes field
- **Validation:**
  - Requires tenant selection for specific/multiple scope
  - Requires scheduled time for scheduled execution
  - Validates scheduled time is in the future

#### RestoreBackupForm
- **Restore Modes:**
  - Full restore (replace all data - DESTRUCTIVE)
  - Merge restore (preserve existing data)
  - Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)
- **Selective Restore:**
  - Option to restore only specific tenants
  - Multi-select tenant list
- **Additional Fields:**
  - Target timestamp for PITR
  - Reason field (required for audit trail)
  - Confirmation checkbox
- **Validation:**
  - Validates tenant selection for selective restore
  - Validates target timestamp for PITR
  - Ensures selective restore only for tenant backups

#### BackupFilterForm
- Filter backups by:
  - Backup type
  - Status
  - Tenant
  - Date range (from/to)

### 2. Service Layer (apps/backups/services.py)
Created BackupService class with key methods:

#### trigger_manual_backup()
- Supports all backup scopes (all, specific, multiple tenants)
- Handles immediate and scheduled execution
- Queues Celery tasks for each tenant
- Includes configuration backup option
- Returns detailed results with job IDs and errors
- Logs all operations for audit trail

#### trigger_restore()
- Creates BackupRestoreLog entry
- Validates backup status
- Queues restore operation as Celery task
- Supports all restore modes
- Returns restore log ID for tracking

#### get_backup_statistics()
- Calculates total backups, completed, failed, in-progress
- Computes total storage usage
- Returns latest backup information
- Provides backup counts by type

### 3. Celery Tasks (apps/backups/tasks.py)
Added wrapper functions for manual triggers:

#### perform_full_database_backup()
- Wrapper for daily_full_database_backup
- Accepts notes and created_by_id parameters

#### perform_tenant_backup()
- Wrapper for weekly_per_tenant_backup
- Accepts tenant_id, notes, created_by_id

#### perform_configuration_backup()
- Wrapper for configuration_backup
- Accepts notes and created_by_id

#### perform_restore_operation()
- Downloads backup from storage (R2 → B2 → Local fallback)
- Decrypts and decompresses backup
- Performs restore based on mode:
  - FULL: Uses pg_restore with --clean flag
  - MERGE: Uses pg_restore without --clean
  - PITR: Not yet fully implemented (raises NotImplementedError)
- Updates restore log with results
- Creates alerts on failure
- Uses 4 parallel jobs for faster restore

#### perform_pg_restore()
- Helper function for PostgreSQL restore
- Supports clean mode (destructive)
- Uses 4 parallel jobs
- Handles warnings about existing objects
- 2-hour timeout for large restores

### 4. Views (apps/backups/views.py)

#### backup_dashboard()
- Displays backup health score (0-100)
- Shows statistics cards (total, completed, failed, storage)
- Lists active alerts with acknowledge buttons
- Shows recent backups
- Provides quick action buttons

#### backup_list()
- Paginated list of all backups (25 per page)
- Filter form integration
- Links to detail and restore pages

#### backup_detail()
- Detailed backup information
- Related restore logs
- Related alerts

#### manual_backup()
- Form for triggering manual backups
- Dynamic tenant selection based on scope
- Dynamic scheduled time field
- Success/error message handling
- Redirects to backup list on success

#### restore_backup()
- Restore wizard interface

- Logs actions

### 5. URL Configuration (apps/backups/urls.py)
Created URL patterns:
- `/` - Dashboard
- `/backups/` - Backup list
- `/backups/<uuid>/` - Backup detail
- `/backups/manual/` - Manual backup trigger
- `/restore/` - Restore wizard

- `/alerts/<uuid>/resolve/` - Resolve alert

### 6. Templates
Created three main templates:

#### dashboard.html
- Health score visualization with color-coded progress bar
- Statistics cards with icons
- Quick action buttons
- Active alerts section with acknowledge buttons
- Recent backups table
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

#### manual_backup.html
- Radio button groups for scope and timing
