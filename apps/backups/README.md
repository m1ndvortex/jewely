# Backup & Disaster Recovery System

## Overview

This module implements an enterprise-grade backup and disaster recovery system for the jewelry shop SaaS platform. It provides triple-redundant storage, automated disaster recovery, and comprehensive monitoring capabilities.

## Features

- **Triple-Redundant Storage**: All backups stored in three locations (local, Cloudflare R2, Backblaze B2)
- **Multiple Backup Types**: Full database, tenant-specific, WAL archives, and configuration backups
- **Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)**: Restore to any specific moment within the last 30 days
- **Automated Disaster Recovery**: 1-hour RTO with automated runbook execution
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Real-time alerts for failures, size deviations, and capacity warnings
- **Encryption & Compression**: AES-256 encryption with gzip compression (70-90% size reduction)
- **Integrity Verification**: SHA-256 checksums verified across all storage locations

## Models

### Backup

Tracks all backup operations with comprehensive metadata.

**Fields:**
- `backup_type`: Type of backup (FULL_DATABASE, TENANT_BACKUP, WAL_ARCHIVE, CONFIGURATION)
- `tenant`: Related tenant (for tenant-specific backups)
- `filename`: Name of the backup file
- `size_bytes`: Size of the backup in bytes
- `checksum`: SHA-256 checksum for integrity verification
- `local_path`, `r2_path`, `b2_path`: Storage paths in all three locations
- `status`: Current status (IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, FAILED, VERIFIED)
- `compression_ratio`: Compression efficiency achieved
- `backup_duration_seconds`: Time taken to complete the backup
- `metadata`: Additional metadata (database version, table counts, etc.)

**Methods:**

### BackupAlert

Tracks backup-related alerts and notifications.

**Fields:**

- `details`: Additional details (metrics, thresholds, etc.)
- `notification_channels`: Channels where alert was sent (email, SMS, in-app, webhook)
- `status`: Current status (ACTIVE, ACKNOWLEDGED, RESOLVED)
- `acknowledged_by`, `resolved_by`: Users who acknowledged/resolved the alert

**Methods:**
- `is_active()`: Check if alert is still active
- `is_critical()`: Check if alert is critical severity
- `acknowledge(user)`: Acknowledge the alert
- `resolve(user, notes)`: Resolve the alert

## Database Schema

### Indexes

The following indexes are created for efficient querying:

**Backup:**
- `backup_type_created_idx`: (backup_type, -created_at)
- `backup_tenant_created_idx`: (tenant, -created_at)
- `backup_status_idx`: (status)
- `backup_created_idx`: (created_at)

**BackupRestoreLog:**
- `restore_started_idx`: (-started_at)
- `restore_status_idx`: (status)
- `restore_backup_started_idx`: (backup, -started_at)

**BackupAlert:**
- `alert_type_created_idx`: (alert_type, -created_at)
- `alert_severity_status_idx`: (severity, status)
- `alert_status_created_idx`: (status, -created_at)
- `alert_created_idx`: (-created_at)

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Full Database Backup

```python
from apps.backups.models import Backup

backup = Backup.objects.create(
    backup_type=Backup.FULL_DATABASE,
    filename="full_backup_2025_10_25.sql.gz.enc",
    size_bytes=1024 * 1024 * 500,  # 500 MB
    checksum="abc123def456",
    r2_path="backups/full/2025/10/full_backup_2025_10_25.sql.gz.enc",
    b2_path="backups/full/2025/10/full_backup_2025_10_25.sql.gz.enc",
    status=Backup.COMPLETED,
    compression_ratio=0.3,
    backup_duration_seconds=300,
)
```

### Creating a Tenant-Specific Backup

```python
from apps.backups.models import Backup
from apps.core.models import Tenant

tenant = Tenant.objects.get(slug="my-shop")

backup = Backup.objects.create(
    backup_type=Backup.TENANT_BACKUP,
    tenant=tenant,
    filename=f"tenant_{tenant.id}_2025_10_25.sql.gz.enc",
    size_bytes=1024 * 1024 * 50,  # 50 MB
    checksum="xyz789abc123",
    r2_path=f"backups/tenant/{tenant.id}/2025/10/backup.sql.gz.enc",
    b2_path=f"backups/tenant/{tenant.id}/2025/10/backup.sql.gz.enc",
    status=Backup.COMPLETED,
)
```

### Logging a Restore Operation

```python
from apps.backups.models import BackupRestoreLog

restore_log = BackupRestoreLog.objects.create(
    backup=backup,
    initiated_by=request.user,
    restore_mode=BackupRestoreLog.FULL,
    status=BackupRestoreLog.IN_PROGRESS,
    reason="Disaster recovery after server failure",
)

# After restore completes
restore_log.status = BackupRestoreLog.COMPLETED
restore_log.rows_restored = 1000000
restore_log.duration_seconds = 600
restore_log.save()
```

### Creating an Alert

```python
from apps.backups.models import BackupAlert

alert = BackupAlert.objects.create(
    alert_type=BackupAlert.BACKUP_FAILURE,
    severity=BackupAlert.CRITICAL,
    backup=backup,
    message="Full database backup failed",
    details={
        "error": "Connection timeout to R2",
        "retry_count": 3,
    },
    notification_channels=["email", "sms", "in-app"],
)

# Acknowledge the alert
alert.acknowledge(request.user)

# Resolve the alert
alert.resolve(request.user, notes="Fixed R2 connection issue")
```

## Admin Interface

All models are registered in the Django admin with comprehensive interfaces:

- **Backup Admin**: View all backups with filtering by type, status, and date
- **BackupRestoreLog Admin**: Track all restore operations with performance metrics
- **BackupAlert Admin**: Monitor and manage alerts with bulk acknowledge/resolve actions

## Testing

Comprehensive tests are provided in `apps/backups/tests.py`:

```bash
# Run all backup tests
docker compose exec web pytest apps/backups/tests.py -v

# Run specific test class
docker compose exec web pytest apps/backups/tests.py::TestBackupModel -v
```
