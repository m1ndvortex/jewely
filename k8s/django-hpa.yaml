# ============================================================================
# Django Application Horizontal Pod Autoscaler
# ============================================================================
# Automatically scales Django pods based on CPU and memory usage with
# aggressive scale-up and gradual scale-down policies.
#
# Scaling Configuration:
# - Min Replicas: 3 (high availability baseline)
# - Max Replicas: 10 (handle peak loads)
# - CPU Threshold: 70% (scale up when CPU exceeds 70%)
# - Memory Threshold: 80% (scale up when memory exceeds 80%)
#
# Scaling Behavior:
# - Scale-Up: Aggressive (100% increase every 15s, max 2 pods per 15s)
# - Scale-Down: Gradual (50% decrease every 60s after 5min stabilization)
